      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is the company driving the container movement and the only container platform provider to address every application across the hybrid cloud. It is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. Docker enables true independence between applications and infrastructure and developers and IT ops to unlock their potential and creates a model for better collaboration and innovation. This gives a significant performance boost and reduces the size of the application.</p>

      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>
      <p>Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination. Every virtual machine has virtual devices that provide the same functionality as physical hardware and have additional benefits in terms of portability, manageability and security.</p>
